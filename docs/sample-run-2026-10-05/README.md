# Sample run: 2026-10-05, Tier 1, four engines

**This is a sample run, published deliberately** so readers can check the figures in [../results-2026-10-05-tier1-baselines.md](../results-2026-10-05-tier1-baselines.md). Normal runs write to `results/`, which is not in git.

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `20261005-224157-70runs.jsonl` | Jev, 70 runs |
| `20261005-224548-70runs-claude-sonnet.jsonl` | Claude Sonnet 5.5 through `claude -p`, 70 runs |
| `20261005-224835-70runs-claude-opus.jsonl` | Claude Opus 5.5 through `claude -p`, 70 runs |
| `20261005-230609-70runs-ollama-qwen3-8b.jsonl` | qwen3:8b on Ollama, 70 runs |
| `compare-report.md` | output of `report.py --compare` on the four files |
| `metrics-report.md` | output of `report.py --metrics` on the four files |

All four batches used `--seed 1000`. Each line is one run: the observations exactly as sent, the expected outcome, the engine's decision with its raw response, and the match flags. No API keys are stored.

To rebuild the reports from these files (`report.py` saves a new timestamped report next to the input files, so delete those copies afterwards to keep this folder unchanged):

```
python report.py --compare docs/sample-run-2026-10-05/*.jsonl
python report.py --metrics docs/sample-run-2026-10-05/*.jsonl
```
